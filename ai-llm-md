# CosmosWatcher Backend API

This document describes the backend API for the **CosmosWatcher** suite — specifically the `Singularity` backend. It is intended for frontend developers integrating with the API, including the `Horizon` frontend portal.

---

## 🧩 Authentication

### POST `/api/login`

Authenticate a user and receive a JWT.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "email": "admin@acme.local",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
```

**Success Response:**

```json
{
  "token": "<JWT>"
}
```

The JWT includes:

* `sub`: User ID (UUID)
* `email`: User email
* `is_global_admin`: `true` or `false`
* `tenants`: Array of tenant objects:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "tenant-uuid",
    "slug": "acme",
    "name": "Acme Corporation",
    "role": "admin"
  }
]
```

**JWT Notes:**

* Include the token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for protected endpoints.
* `type` claim = `"access"`
* `exp` claim = expiry timestamp (15 mins default)

---

## 🔐 Protected Endpoints (Coming Soon)

All future endpoints will require Bearer token authentication. Example headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
```

## 🗂 Planned Endpoint Categories

* `/api/me` – return current user info (based on token)
* `/api/tenants` – list/select tenant info
* `/api/nodes` – register and manage Observers
* `/api/telemetry` – ingest data from agents
* `/api/users` – user/tenant admin features

---

## 🌐 Deployment Modes

This API supports both:

* **Single-tenant self-hosted** use (frontend embedded)
* **Multitenant cloud-hosted** mode (frontend separate)

The exact same endpoints are used in both cases.
